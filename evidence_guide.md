## Question 1: What was the process you used to ensure that you would meet all of the required elements of your tutorial?
I made sure that I knew in depth of how to solder and the equipment needed. I then started making a list of all the required tools and the steps on how to solder, I made sure not to overload this with unnecessary information as to not bore the reader.
## Question 2: How did your existing knowledge and/or understanding of Information Technology help inform your work on the tutorial.
Because of my previous knowledge of the topics, I opted for a topic I didn't know much of. There was no coding involved in this so that area would not be useful. I did know some about Arduino circuits so that helped me with understanding the diagrams.
## Question 3: How has your understanding of Information Technology changed from the start of this assignment time until now?
Because of my no previous knowledge on this topic, there was a lot of room to learn. I think that I learned so much as to an intimediate level. I would now be able to solder a ciruit and create complete and lasting joints.
