# Soldering a Small Circuit

## What is Soldering?
![soldering diagram](https://tinyurl.com/p9jad5aj)<br>
Soldering is a joining process used to join different types of metals together by melting solder. Solder is a metal alloy usually made of tin and lead which is melted using a hot iron. The iron is heated to temperatures above 1000°C which then cools to create a strong electrical bond.

## Tools
You wont need a lot of equipment to get started, all the required tools are listed below.

- <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2wepuamc" target="_blank">Soldering iron<a/>
  - The soldering iron is the tool that when powered heats up and allows the solder to melt. It is the most important tool for soldering and comes in different options such as a pen or gun.

  - If you have a soldering iron, the station is not necessary but is a more advanced version of the single pen with the added on extra tools. The main benefit of a station is being able to control the temperature, being suitable for a wider range of projects.
- <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2p9h7uwy" target="_blank">Brass or normal sponge<a/>
  - Using a sponge will help to keep the soldering iron tip clean by removing the oxidation that forms. Tips with oxidation will tend to turn black and not accept solder as it did when it was new. You could use a conventional wet sponge but this tends to shorten the lifespan of the tip due to expansion and contraction.
- <a href="https://tinyurl.com/jh5zc6d" target="_blank">Soldering iron stand<a/>
  - This stand helps prevent the hot iron tip from coming in contact with flammable materials or causing accidental injury to your hand. Most stations come with this already built in so there is no need for an extra one.

  - The solder is the metal material that is melted to create a bond between components. There are many different types of solder available but the most common are lead and lead-free variations with diameters of .032″ and .062″. Rosin core solder contains a mild flux and is designed to solder parts where flux residue cannot be removed.
- <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ycy6hdfh" target="_blank">Helping hand<a/> (optional)
  - A helping hand is a device that has 2 alligator clips and sometimes a magnifying glass attached. While it is not required to solder it becomes very helpful as it is difficult to position the components and solder at the same time.

  - Solder fumes can be toxic when inhaled or to your eyes so make sure your work station is well ventilated. It is recommended to use a fume extractor which is a fan fitted with a charcoal filter that absorbs the harmful fumes. Eye protection is always a good precaution incase there may be a splash of hot solder.

## How to Solder

### Preperation
Before you start soldering, set up your work station and make sure that the fume extractor is working. To create a better solder you will need to thin the tip of the iron. This process will help improve the heat transfer from the iron to the item you’re soldering.
1. Make sure the tip is screwed on correctly.
2. Turn on the soldering iron and let it heat up. If there is a temperature dial, set it correctly. The temperature will vary depending on your solder, 316°- 400°C is a good place to start for lead-based solder and 360°- 440°C for lead-free solder.
3. Wipe the tip into the brass sponge or regular sponge to clean it.
4. Hold the iron and solder in each hand. Touch the solder to the tip of the iron and make sure the solder flows evenly around the tip. Doing this each time before soldering will ensure that your iron does not get wrecked.

  
## Practice
**Practice 1**<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solder a resistor to a copper wire<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take any resistor and try to attach it to the end of a copper wire.
<br><br>
**Practice 2**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the solder<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the desoldering pump to take apart both components and remove any solder.
