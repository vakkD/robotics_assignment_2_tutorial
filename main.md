# Soldering a Small Circuit

## What is Soldering?
![soldering diagram](https://tinyurl.com/p9jad5aj)<br>
Soldering is a joining process used to join different types of metals together by melting solder. Solder is a metal alloy usually made of tin and lead which is melted using a hot iron. The iron is heated to temperatures above 1000°C which then cools to create a strong electrical bond.

## Tools
You wont need a lot of equipment to get started, all the required tools are listed below.

- <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2wepuamc" target="_blank">Soldering iron<a/>
  - The soldering iron is the tool that when powered heats up and allows the solder to melt. It is the most important tool for soldering and comes in different options such as a pen or gun.
- <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2p9h7uwy" target="_blank">Brass or normal sponge<a/>
  - Using a sponge will help to keep the soldering iron tip clean by removing the oxidation that forms. Tips with oxidation will tend to turn black and not accept solder as it did when it was new. You could use a conventional wet sponge but this tends to shorten the lifespan of the tip due to expansion and contraction.
- <a href="https://tinyurl.com/jh5zc6d" target="_blank">Soldering iron stand<a/>
  - This stand helps prevent the hot iron tip from coming in contact with flammable materials or causing accidental injury to your hand. Most stations come with this already built in so there is no need for an extra one.

  - The solder is the metal material that is melted to create a bond between components. There are many different types of solder available but the most common are lead and lead-free variations with diameters of .032″ and .062″. Rosin core solder contains a mild flux and is designed to solder parts where flux residue cannot be removed.

  - Solder fumes can be toxic when inhaled or to your eyes so make sure your work station is well ventilated. It is recommended to use a fume extractor which is a fan fitted with a charcoal filter that absorbs the harmful fumes. Eye protection is always a good precaution incase there may be a splash of hot solder.
- <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3ka9ycd" target="_blank">Desoldering pump<a/>
  - This tool comes most commonly in pen form, similar to a solder iron. Pressing the button decompresses the seal and sucks up the liquid solder. 
- <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2p9xcfb9" target="_blank">Soldering station<a/> (optional)
  - If you have a soldering iron, the station is not necessary but is a more advanced version of the single pen with the added on extra tools. The main benefit of a station is being able to control the temperature, being suitable for a wider range of projects.
- <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ycy6hdfh" target="_blank">Helping hand<a/> (optional)
  - A helping hand is a device that has 2 alligator clips and sometimes a magnifying glass attached. While it is not required to solder it becomes very helpful as it is difficult to position the components and solder at the same time.
  
  
## How to use a Desolder/Sucker Tool
A desoldering pump, or solder sucker is a handy tool that sucks molten solder. You can use it to desolder through-hole components on a circuit board or to rework bad solder joints.
1. Press down the plunger until it locks into place.
2. Heat the solder until it is liquified.
4. Place the pump's nozzle as close to the liquid solder as possible (the nozzle is made of heat-resistant plastic, so don't worry about it melting from heat.)
2. Press the side button to release the plunger and suck up the solder.
  
## How to Solder  
### Preperation
Before you start soldering, set up your work station and make sure that the fume extractor is working. To create a better solder you will need to thin the tip of the iron. This process will help improve the heat transfer from the iron to the item you’re soldering.
1. Make sure the tip is screwed on correctly.
2. Turn on the soldering iron and let it heat up. If there is a temperature dial, set it correctly. The temperature will vary depending on your solder, 316°- 400°C is a good place to start for lead-based solder and 360°- 440°C for lead-free solder.
3. Wipe the tip into the brass sponge or regular sponge to clean it.
4. Hold the iron and solder in each hand. Touch the solder to the tip of the iron and make sure the solder flows evenly around the tip. Doing this each time before soldering will ensure that your iron does not get wrecked.

### Soldering (refer to [diagram](#what-is-soldering))
1. Mount the components on the board or into the helping hands or position them to begin soldering.
1. Touch the tip of the iron to either the copper pad and the metal bar of the component or straight onto the wire, depending on what you are soldering.
1. Continue touching the tip onto the area and touch the solder on the joint. Make sure to not touch the solder directly onto the tip. The joint has to be hot enough to melt the solder, if not it will create a bad connection.
1. When the solder has melted and is covering the desired area, remove the tip of the iron from the solder and let it cool and harden.
  
## Practice
**Practice 1**<br>
Solder a resistor to a copper wire<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take two small length copper wire and solder a 220 ohms resistor. To do this solder may already have to be applied to one or both of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wires.
<br><br>
**Practice 2**<br>
Remove the solder<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the desoldering pump to remove the solder and disassemble back to two wires and a resistor. Make sure that all the solder has been &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;removed from the components.
  
## Challenge
**Make a small circuit**<br>
Print out <a href="https://github.com/vakkD/robotics_assignment_2_tutorial/blob/main/ledbuttoncircuit.png?raw=true">this diagram<a/> and glue it to a piece of cardboard, if it has not been already (<a href="https://electronicsclub.info/circuitsymbols.htm">document for circuit symbols if needed<a/>). And press the components into the board, over where they go on the diagram, connect and solder them together using copper wire.
